Lexly is a web application designed to assist dyslexic individuals with reading and comprehension. It provides two key features:

1. Text Summarization: Lexly uses a custom algorithm to generate concise summaries of the input text. The algorithm takes into account word frequency and sentence position to identify the most important sentences and create a summary that captures the main points of the text.

2. Text-to-Speech: Lexly utilizes the Web Speech API to convert the input text into speech. Users can click the "Speak" button to listen to the text being read aloud, and the "Stop" button to stop the speech. This feature helps dyslexic individuals who may struggle with reading by providing an audio alternative.

Lexly is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The app is designed with a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to input text, generate summaries, and listen to the text being read aloud.

The app also includes a visually appealing and professional design, utilizing warm colors and animations to enhance the user experience. The styling is implemented using CSS to ensure a polished and engaging look.
